# PI Recorder Chop (working title) 

Intended to allow users to take audio recordings of an area of interest, without compromising privacy of the recordees or the fidelity of recordings.

The application takes sound recordings, then reorders 'chunks' of samples into a random sequence so the nature of conversations are kept private, whilst keeping the high fidelity of recording.
